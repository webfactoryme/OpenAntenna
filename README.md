Open Antenna is a open source "Platform in a Box" under active development. The intention is to allow anyone to create their own media or publishing platform using their own server to host the content.

To get a test instance going, spin up a new Debian 11 instance, and run the following command:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webfactoryme/OpenAntenna/main/tools/openantenna_installer.sh && sh openantenna_installer.sh
